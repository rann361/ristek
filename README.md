During the process of creating a to-do app, I learned a lot about mobile development.
First, I learned about designing my app and how to make it user-friendly.
I learn about flutter and its widget component.
I also learned about implementing features such as adding and deleting tasks.

Reference that i use are :
1. YouTube video tutorials from the documentation.
2. Flutter documentation.
3. Stackoverflow for problem solving.

Feature that i have in this app:
1. Add task
2. Update task
3. Delete task by sliding
4. Editing profile
